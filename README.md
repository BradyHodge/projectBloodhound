# Project Bloodhound

Quickly navigate to your project directory, now with fuzzy finding!

## Quick Start

Run the setup script to get started, if you ever want to change the setup options:

- Type `$PROFILE` into the terminal
- Open the ps1 file shown in a text editor
- Look for `function bh`
- Edit the variables (they look like `$VariableName = NULL`)

## To Remove

- Type `$PROFILE` into the terminal
- Open the ps1 file shown in a text editor
- Look for `function bh`
- Delete the function and everything between the squiggly brackets {}
- Delete the `BloodHound.ps1` file in the same folder as the powershell profile file that you just edited
