# Project Bloodhound

Quickly navigate to your project directory in the windows terminal, now with fuzzy finding! All you have to do is define where you keep your projects and optionally auto open VS Code.

## Quick Start

Run the setup script to get started, then type `BloodHound <foldername>` (or `bh <foldername>`).

If you ever want to change the setup options:

- Type `$PROFILE` into the terminal
- Open the ps1 file shown in a text editor
- Look for the Bloodhound config section
- Edit the variables (they look like `$VariableName = NULL`)

## To Remove

- Type `$PROFILE` into the terminal
- Open the ps1 file shown in a text editor
- Look for the Bloodhound config section and delete everything in that section
- Delete the `BloodHound.ps1` file in the same folder as the powershell profile file that you just edited

## Manual Setup
